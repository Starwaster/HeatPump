HeatPump from RealFuels, updated for KSP 1.2.2

The purpose of Heat Pump is to cool down cryogenic tanks and prevent (or retard) boiloff.
Pumps can be configured with the following features.
* An amount of heat is removed from protected parts (active refrigeration) equal to a flat rate multiplied by a temperature delta.
* The flat rate is capped at ten times the flat rate value by default.
* The heat pumps also attempt to remove any heat that leaked into the part's interior (from the skin and adjacent parts)
* Resource cost per kilowatt of heat removed.
* The amount of heat moved into the radiator is split up among any symmetrically added radiators.

This mod comes with a radiator part created by zzz (licensed by GingerCorp).
Heat Pump versions of all stock radiators are also included.
